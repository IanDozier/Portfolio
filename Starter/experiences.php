                        In the summer of 2023, I had the amazing opportunity to be a research assistant at Auburn University.
                        There I worked on an online learning platform for K-12 students and where I learned to make web pages like the one you're currently interacting with.
                        I also worked on a VR simulation for the Navy and under my mentor,

                        I learned to apply key concepts and techniques which include,
                        data structures, object-oriented programming (OOP), and I learned a little about algorithms.

                        In the summer of 2024, I had another amazing opportunity and that was to study abroad in Paris.
                        In Paris, I learned French and reinforced grammar, in addition to working on my oral speaking abilities.
                        My program and I visited countless châteaus, and learned about the history behind each one of them.
                        I was able to visit the Louvre and La Musée d'Orsay, where not only did I see countless, marvelous paintings but also
                        incredible sculptures.
