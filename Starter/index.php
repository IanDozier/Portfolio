        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Ian Dozier and I attend the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.
            There isn't a lot to be said about me. I like to program, play video games, binge-watch movies.
            However, I deeply love to learn and I also really enjoy exercising. I'm originally from High Point, North Carolina which is the furniture
            capitol of the world. I came to love programming my first year at UNCW and how it felt like an awesome annoying game that you just can't
            quit trying to beat. From endless error messages to changing one line of code and your computer freezes but, you keep typing and trying.
            Hoping to beat the game and learn something along the way. <b>Also did you click on my face at the top yet? Give it a try.</b>

                I'm currently majoring in computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity, while also minoring in French.
                I'm currently on track to graduate in May 2025 with a 3.3 gpa. During my time at UNCW I met a lot of amazing students and
                faculty members. I was able to program a to-do list with my classmates, and I even made a game called MineSweeper. I've learned the
                different data structures, object-oriented programming techniques and all the way up to the complexities of algorithms. In addition to
                how CPUs run and behave, and how a computer makes network calls with its own unique address, or an ip address.

                        In the summer of 2023, I had the amazing opportunity to be a research assistant at Auburn University.
                        There I worked on an online learning platform for K-12 students and where I learned to make web pages like the one you're currently interacting with.
                        I also worked on a VR simulation for the Navy and under my mentor,

                        I learned to apply key concepts and techniques which include,
                        data structures, object-oriented programming (OOP), and I learned a little about algorithms.

                        In the summer of 2024, I had another amazing opportunity and that was to study abroad in Paris.
                        In Paris, I learned French and reinforced grammar, in addition to working on my oral speaking abilities.
                        My program and I visited countless châteaus, and learned about the history behind each one of them.
                        I was able to visit the Louvre and La Musée d'Orsay, where not only did I see countless, marvelous paintings but also
                        incredible sculptures.
