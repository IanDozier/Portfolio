            I'm currently majoring in computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity, while also minoring in French.
            I'm currently on track to graduate in May 2025 with a 3.3 gpa. During my time at UNCW I met a lot of amazing students and
            faculty members. I was able to program a to-do list with my classmates, and I even made a game called MineSweeper. I've learned the
            different data structures, object-oriented programming techniques and all the way up to the complexities of algorithms. In addition to
            how CPUs run and behave, and how a computer makes network calls with its own unique address, or an ip address.
