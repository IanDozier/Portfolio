    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Ian Dozier and I attend the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.
        There isn't a lot to be said about me. I like to program, play video games, binge-watch movies.
        However, I deeply love to learn and I also really enjoy exercising. I'm originally from High Point, North Carolina which is the furniture
        capitol of the world. I came to love programming my first year at UNCW and how it felt like an awesome annoying game that you just can't
        quit trying to beat. From endless error messages to changing one line of code and your computer freezes but, you keep typing and trying.
        Hoping to beat the game and learn something along the way. <b>Also did you click on my face at the top yet? Give it a try.</b>
